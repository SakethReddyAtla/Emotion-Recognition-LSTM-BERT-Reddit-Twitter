# Emotion-Recognition-LSTM-BERT-Reddit-Twitter
This project compares LSTM and BERT models for emotion recognition using Reddit's GoEmotions and Twitter datasets. LSTM uses Word2Vec embeddings and a refined architecture, while BERT is fine-tuned for sequence classification. Results show BERT generally outperforms LSTM, emphasizing model choice and data balance.
